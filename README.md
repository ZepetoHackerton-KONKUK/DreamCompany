### [Theme] 
Nightmaker—an employee of Dream Company, a company specializing in crafting nightmares.

### [Our USP]
1. 'KONKUK' Team's Unique Interpretation of Dreams and World Style
We adopted the fundamental human question of "Where dreams come from?" as the main background for our game design (as seen earlier in "What we want to tell the judges"). This idea puts a twist on the negative keywords that often come to mind when we think of "nightmares": horror, fear, pain, bleakness, and loss.

By maintaining the tone and manner of the 'nightmare' we typically associate with it, while imagining a world in which the company that creates the nightmare exists - the Dream Company - it transforms a potentially heavy subject into something that is both familiar and exciting to us.

The game starts as players move from the ticket gate to the waiting room of 'Dream Company', mirroring the daily routine of commuters passing through subway gates to go to work, thereby enhancing realism and immersion.

Additionally, we've added fun elements to the game with the sub-concept of 'kids who don't easily feel fear in modern times' (similar to the concept of a devil made redundant by greater human atrocities). As the world evolves, kids no longer fear simple nightmares. However, to earn scores and 'Crystals', players need to strive to become stronger 'Nightmakers', understanding and catering to the fears kids do feel.

2. Designing a World that inspires creativity and motivation in users
We have designed a system that allows users to unleash their creativity while also challenges in the game. 

  By giving users the role of 'Nightmaker', an employee who is tasked with giving kids nightmares at ‘Dream Company’, they can recognize their mission in our world.

  We also give users a reason to want to play and stay in our world, knowing that the more scary nightmares they give kids, the more 'Crystals' they can earn to advance in the company, and the higher their game score ranking to be recognized.

  Consistency in concept and ongoing storytelling is also a point of pride in our world. Elements such as the intro video, transitions between game phases, statements within loading images, and overall world design effectively communicate the intended concept to users. Users will likely quickly grasp our world's concept and find resonance with the story.

  'Special Items' are another way to motivate users to play your game. These items can be used to decorate the user's avatar with colorful effects, creating a desire to collect them. (It's a proven fact in ZEPETO that you want to make your avatar look better.) In order to collect ‘Special Items’, user need to collect ‘Crystals’, which in turn motivates you to play the game again. They can also act as bait to take pictures in the world and share them on user’s feed.

3. Fundamental Human Psychology and Desire Stimulating Content Planning
The French scholar Roger Caillois, building upon the theory of 'Homo Ludens', defined the 'four elements of play' as 'Agon (competition)', 'Mimicry (role-playing)', 'Ilinx (vertigo)', and 'Alea (chance)' in his book 'Man, Plays and Games'. These four elements are known to have evolved in all forms of human play and are considered very important theories in modern video games.

  In our world, these four elements of play are applied in every corner of the content.

  'Crossroads' and 'Pieces: Puzzle' are simple casual/puzzle games that simultaneously feature multiplayer and voting, competitive elements, allowing users to feel a sense of achievement and superiority by winning against other users. The real-time ranking competition in 'Crossroads' and the variety in 'Pieces: Puzzle' from different pictures, voting results, and the novelty of the changing puzzles make the game enjoyable for users. (Agon, Ilinx)

  By placing the ranking board prominently and centrally in the world, we stimulate the desire to become a top-ranked player and the desire to show off, providing a strong motivation to play. Users who achieve ranks 1 to 3 will likely feel immense exhilaration. (Agon, Ilinx)

  As previously mentioned, by assigning the role of 'Nightmaker', we allow users to experience new emotions and experiences unique to our 'Dream Company'. Various ranks provide users with goals for achievement, and the 'Tier Icon' and 'ID Card Frame' obtained upon tier promotion help users feel both recognition for their position earned through gameplay and the desire to collect items. (Mimicry, Ilinx)

  Lastly, in our world, the game-changer item 'Soup' maximizes Alea (chance) and Ilinx (vertigo). The buff effect of 'Soup' carries extreme probabilities. Users can experience catharsis as they obtain more dramatic percentage buffs from the high-priced 'Soup' item. At the same time, the less desirable buff effects motivate users to invest more 'jam' in our World to achieve better effects.

### [Overall World Flow / Game Composition]
1. Intro: When a user first enters the world, they are greeted with an opening video that encapsulates the concept of our world. This video is skippable and serves to preview the experiences they will have at Dream Company.

2. World Entry: Upon entering the world, users spawn at a designated location. They can explore the world and interact with staff at the Help Desk.

3. Game Flow: To start the main game, players must follow arrows marked 'START' on the floor and pass through a ticket gate to reach the waiting room. In the waiting room, a 40-second countdown begins as players wait for others to join the game. After 40 seconds, an additional 15-second wait is implemented to prevent players from leaving. During this extra wait, players cannot move. Once the waiting time is over, players can play the 'Crossroads & Pieces (Puzzle)' game, earn scores, and collect 'Crystal' for tier advancement in 'Dream Company'. At the end of the game, players exit through the 'EXIT' gate and return to the Dream Company lobby.

4. World Space Composition: Our World consists of areas such as the lobby, help desks, waiting room, lounge, and photo spots. The initial spawn point for users is the lobby, surrounded by four help desks. These desks help 'Nightmakers' achieve their goals smoothly in 'Dream Company'. Detailed explanations will follow in the next section. The waiting room is where users wait for other players for multiplayer gameplay. Like commuting to work by passing through a platform's ticket gates and taking the subway in real life, the 'Nightmakers' also pass through gates to embark on their work. The lounge and photo spots are spaces created to convey the concept of a 'company'. Here, users can interact, take beautiful photos, and share them on the ZEPETO feed.

5. World UI: The default UI of our World is composed as follows:
  - User's current job title and tier icon.
  - Number of 'Crystals' owned.
  - 'Soup' bonus percentage and remaining game turns for the bonus.
  - User profile photo with an ID card border item.
  - World missions.
  - 7-day attendance reward.
  - World usage guide.
  - Pose selection.
  - Raking System (Leaderboard)

### [Game : Crossroads & Pieces(Puzzle)]
Note: From least one, Multi-play is possible to eight. 
The number of users who enter the waiting room during the total wait time determines the number of players in the game. (If only one user enters during a wait of about a minute, you'll be playing alone. However, we are more multiplayer-oriented because it gives user an extra score bonus when playing multiplayer.)

1. Crossroads (Play Time : Approx. 1 min)
The game begins with the loading image and the phrase "Have you heard? About the crossroads in dreams... Follow me." This suggests to the user that the 'Crossroads' game involves guiding kids to nightmares or pleasant dreams at a metaphorical crossroads in dreams. After showing examples of success and failure, the main game starts. Kids slide down a slide rapidly, and the user must scare them at the right moment at the crossroads leading to nightmares or good dreams. If the user successfully scares the kids at the right time, it's considered a success in leading them to a nightmare. The game scores are calculated based on how accurately the user scares the kids with ratings like ‘Perfect’, ‘Great’, or ‘Good’. Continuous successful scares earn the user 'Combo' points, and the speed of the kids sliding down increases. Missing the timing leads the kids to a pleasant dream, rated as ‘Bad’, and resets the 'Combo' and speed. In multiplayer, players can see their scores and rankings in real-time in the top right corner.
(Note: The scoring for Crossroads is calculated as ‘Good 100(1+Combo(0.1++, max=1)), Great 150*(1+Combo), Perfect 200*(1+Combo)’.)

2. Pieces : Puzzle (Play Time : Approx. 2~3 min)
After 'Crossroads', as the kids fall into a nightmare, the game transitions to 'Pieces'. The loading screen displays the phrases "I’ll make unforgettable nightmares for kids who don't know fear..." and "What kind of nightmare shall we create today", helping the user understand the game's backstory and their role. Players then have 1 minute to use their creativity to depict the nightmare that the kids guided in 'Crossroads' will experience. Various colors, pen thicknesses, and an eraser are provided for drawing the nightmare. After 1 minute, a loading video plays, and voting begins. Each player’s nightmare drawing is put to a vote, and one is selected (skipped in solo play). This voting process allows sharing the creativity of other players’ nightmare drawings. The top-voted drawing is broken into puzzle pieces shaped like the Dream Company logo. Players have 30 seconds to correctly assemble the puzzle, which is divided into 6 pieces and shuffled randomly. Completing the puzzle results in the nightmare being absorbed into the kid's dreams, ending the game. Players can then see their final score, combining 'Crossroads' and 'Pieces', and the nightmare crystals obtained.
(Note: The scoring for Pieces is ‘500 per correct piece, +100 for extra time, 1.5% for winning votes’. The final score is calculated as ‘[(Crossroads Score + Pieces Score)/(50-2Tier) * Soup Bonus] + {200/(25rank)} * Number of players)]’.)


### [Help Desk in Company]
1. Where to buy Nightmare 'Crystal’: This help desk functions as a store where users can purchase 'Crystal', a currency in 'Dream Company', using 'jam'. This is one of our world's revenue models.

2. Where to make nightmare ‘Soup’: This is the place where users can make the ‘Soup’ item, which randomly grants a final game score bonus buff. The ‘Soup’ buff is applied for three rounds of the game. If the user is not satisfied with the bonus, they can remake the soup. Even though the bonus could be applied for two more games, if the soup is remade, the existing bonus disappears and is replaced with a new buff that will last for three games. ‘Soup’ can be made with 30,000 'Crystals' or 42 'jams'. By setting a high production cost, users are encouraged to feel a sense of challenge and desire to own the ‘Soup’ item. Additionally, the randomness of the bonus chances provides more excitement for the users. Especially, the higher the lucky bonus figures appear, the more the users will feel a sense of achievement and pride, fulfilling one of the four elements of play, 'Alea' (chance).

3. Where to buy 'special items': This is where user can purchase ‘special items’ in the world that have effects that make a user's avatar more unique. It consists of a total of 15 effects, each priced differently. (Available for purchase with Crystal) Purchased items can be worn, removed, or changed at any time. If the user is wearing a ‘special item’, the effect is visible when their avatar is active in the world or when playing a Crossroads game.

4. Where to apply ID card frames: In Dream Company, there are 10 positions for Nightmakers, and each position has a 'Tier' and an 'ID Card Frame'. Users can receive an 'ID Card Frame' according to their tier every time they advance through leveling up. The received 'ID card frame' can be checked at the help desk and can be unworn and changed at any time.

### [Game systems]
1. (Nightmare) Crystal: The currency in the 'Dream Company' (i.e. money). 'Crystal' is used to make 'Soup', purchase 'Special Item', level up, etc. and is an essential element to use the World. Users can earn 'Crystal' by playing the game, which are a percentage of their final score, or they can purchase them for 'jam' at the help desk.
(Note: 3,600 Crystal = 5 jam / 7,300 Crystal = 10 jam / 20,000 Crystal = 25 jam)

2. (Nightmare) Soup: 'Soup' is a buff item that has a bonus effect on the final score of the game. The bonus % is determined by a very random chance. The 'Soup' item is a game changer for the scoring system, ranks, and rewards in 'Dream Company', as it can be utilized by users to achieve World Rank.
(Note: Soup can be made at the Help Desk, and the bonus keeps working for three rounds of play. It costs 30,000 crystals or 42 jam to made.)

3. Tier in Dream Company(Level up): There are a total of 10 positions (tiers) in ‘Dream Company’, each named 'Nightmaker', 'Intruder of Dream', 'Nightmare Artisan', 'Maestro of Nightmare', 'Master of Nightmare', 'Wicked Nightmaker', 'Evil Nightmaker', 'Diabolical Nightmaker', 'Malevolent Nightmaker', and 'CEO of Nightmare'. These position names are designed to convey a sense of increasing power as users level up, ultimately reaching the pinnacle as the 'CEO of Nightmare,' making them feel like the owner of a 'Dream Company'.
(Note: Users can utilize 'Tier Icons' and 'ID Card Frames' for each position (tier), and their game score will receive a bonus corresponding to their position.)

### [World UI : Detailed description]
1. World Missions: In 'Dream Company,' users receive an achievement reward each time they advance to the next level.

2. 7-day attendance reward: World login rewards are distributed over a 7-day period. After completing the 7-day cycle, user attendance resets, allowing users to become eligible for rewards once again.

3. Ranking System(Leaderboard): In 'Dream Company,' the final scores obtained in the 'Crossroads' and 'Pieces' games are accumulated to determine the world ranking. The top 1-3 rankings are prominently displayed on the world billboard. This instills a sense of pride in users and sparks a strong desire to achieve the rank, creating a powerful motivation.
(Note: The rankings reset every month on the first Monday at 9:00 PM.)

4. World Guide: Offering a guide on how to enjoy the 'Dream Company' World. Users can utilize this guide for a quick introduction to the world.

5. Pose selection: Provide the ability for users to pose in various poses in the world. Useful for taking photos in the world,
